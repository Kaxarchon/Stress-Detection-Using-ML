# Stress-Detection-Using-ML
This project uses the stress.csv file to train the model, which is a Naive-Bayes model.
The .doc file has the list of literature surveys and the techniques used in those literature for stress detection.
In the stress.csv file the label is targetted as the label column indicates the stress - 0 for non-stress and 1 for stress.
The code uses aspects of natural language processing using stopwords and snowballstemmer libraries of python.
